- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Work2Wrok
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in primarily getting my 10yo into coding using C, Python, etc. He just got ESP-32 Wrover starter kit from Amazon which can use Adruino IDE. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Adruino and Macbook Pro innerworkings. I have some Java and C experience from school days of yesteryear so it's been a while.
- I plan in scrubing forums for Q&As and posting for help when needed. Hope to contribute someday, but we gotta start somewhere I guess.
- MBP wont communicate with ESP-32, so that's the first challenge to tackle...which is how I found Github to start with.
- Didn't even relaize you could change drivers in Mac - lol. Of course whether a cable transfers data or just charges is another fine learning. Welp, here we go...
- Wish us luck and looking forward to chating with some of you!
